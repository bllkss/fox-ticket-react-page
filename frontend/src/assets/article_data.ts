        'BKK to test a unique digital solution in Hungary on the direct airport shuttlebus line in 2023',

      content: `BKK Centre for Budapest Transport is about to take another step forward in the field of digitalisation. Together with Mastercard, Monet+ and K&H, the mobility manager will be testing a technical solution that will make public transport even faster and easier. During the trial period, customers will need nothing more than a physical or digitised bankcard with contactless payment functionality on the 100E airport shuttlebus line.

      BKK, K&H bank, Mastercard and software development company Monet+ will be testing a digital solution that has never been used in Hungary before but is already working well in several parts of the world, providing access to public transport.

      Thanks to the innovative technology, BKK’s customers will be able to use the 100E airport shuttle without prior registration, using their bankcard, smartphone or smartwatch. However, this solution is much more than just an ordinary bankcard purchase. The transaction is validated at the same time, and the customer’s bankcard can be used to prove entitlement to travel in the event of ticket inspection later.

      This means that passengers will not need to buy paper tickets in advance, and even if they are not yet familiar with the benefits of BudapestGO and have not downloaded the popular ticketing and journey planning app on their phone, it should not be a problem. They will just need to take out their bankcard or smartphone and use it at the on-board device.

      This solution is faster than traditional bankcard payments. In addition to the extremely short technical processing time, the new system also speeds up the purchase process by automatically charging the fare for the given ride - for example, the price of the Airport Shuttlebus Single Ticket on the 100E bus - to the customer’s bankcard.`,

      content: `BKK Centre for Budapest Transport's BudapestGO app has been updated with new convenience features. With more than one and a half million users, the app allows customers to plan their journeys more accurately and use it faster thanks to improvements. For those who do not have automatic updates set, they will need to update their app to activate the new features.
      
      As promised, BKK is continuously improving its BudapestGO application, which was launched in February. Based on customer feedback, several new features were added to BKK's popular app in the first days of October.
      
      Journey planning while travelling in a vehicle

      An internationally unique new feature has been added to BudapestGO, called "On-board Journey Planning" in the app. Now you can plan a new route on the go, conveniently - even during an unexpected traffic jam. This gives customers real-time, up-to-the-minute arrival information, because the app also takes into account the time spent in the vehicle when calculating the route. So, for example, it won't direct you on foot to the next stop or try to make you board the next vehicle.

      Filter by vehicle category

      With BudapestGO, customers can now filter the type of vehicle, choosing between underground, street-level or fixed-rail services. This feature can help customers with reduced mobility or wheelchair users to plan more ideal, barrier-free routes, and for example families with small children or tourists, to calculate their above-ground connections.

      The app is faster

      The app is now faster to open and it takes 1-3 seconds less time to load than before, depending on the phone type. This means that passengers can plan their journeys, buy tickets or passes in less time and show their digital products more quickly.`,

      title: 'New passenger information elements at major terminuses',
      pic: i3,
      date: 'Budapest, 20 September 2022',
      content: `From now on, BKK’s customers are able to find the lines they need to reach their destination much more simply at terminuses, as the company is in the process of renewing the passenger information system at major transport hubs. Thanks to the project related to terminuses, the level of passenger information further increases.
      
      The lines and customers of BKK Centre for Budapest Transport use over 5,800 stops on a daily basis, therefore the company handles on-the-spot passenger information with high priority, besides the development of digital channels. BKK’s staff changes nearly 30,000 displayed information boards on an annual basis in the Hungarian capital, and recently even the entire review and renewal of passenger information elements at major transport hubs to be found in Budapest have been begun.
      
      In the project’s first phase, BKK’s professionals specialised in this field assess the condition of information boards displayed at terminuses, subsequently to which, all of the elements in bad conditions will be renewed. The passenger information signposts along with their passenger information to be found on these posts will be renewed. Even vehicles’ number will be indicated in a bigger size on the renewed boards, enabling BKK’s customers to check from distance the lines that are available at the given stop.`,
